<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following history was read to
the congregation of the Rev. John Alexander, at a tea party in
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, on Tuesday evening, April 6,
1847, which was held for the purpose of celebrating the thirtieth
year of his ministry.&nbsp; It is now published in compliance
with their request, and in the same style of personal address in
which it was originally delivered.&nbsp; After it had been read,
several members of the congregation addressed the meeting; and
the following resolutions were unanimously passed:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Moved by Mr. Thomas Banks, seconded by Rev. J.
Bryan.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That the history of the Church and
Congregation connected with Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel, during
the last thirty years, which has now been read, should awaken in
our minds devout gratitude to God for graciously enabling us to
overcome the various difficulties which have arisen in our
course; for the enlargement, peace, and prosperity which have
been granted to the Church, and to the Institutions associated
with it; and for bringing us together at this time under
circumstances which are calculated to awaken encouraging hope for
the future.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>II.&nbsp; Moved by Mr. Joseph Colman, seconded by Mr.
Thomas Brooks.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That on this Thirtieth Anniversary of the
residence of our beloved Pastor in Norwich, we are devoutly
grateful to God for having first directed him hither, and for
having permitted him to labour so long and so successfully
amongst us: that we affectionately thank him, for his constant
and faithful devotedness to the work of the ministry and the
welfare of his people; and that we earnestly pray, that for yet
many years to come, he may be spared to enjoy richly the
blessings of the gospel, which he dispenses to others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>III.&nbsp; Moved by Mr. Frederic Pigg, seconded by Mr. Charles
May and Mr. Josiah Fletcher,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That an increased acquaintance with the
doctrines and influence of the gospel of Christ, deepens our
conviction of the importance of steadfastly adhering, in our
Christian profession and practice, to the great and essential
truths of evangelical religion, as declared by this church at its
formation; and of promulgating them universally, in connection
with those principles of ecclesiastical polity, which we believe
to be alike in accordance with sacred scripture, and with
religious liberty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speeches delivered on this interesting occasion were
reported in the <i>Norfolk News</i> of April 10, 1847, and the
following account of the meeting is extracted from its
columns:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Tuesday evening the congregation of
Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel, Norwich, held a Soir&eacute;e in
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, for the purpose of celebrating the
thirtieth anniversary of the ministry of the Rev. John
Alexander.&nbsp; About eight hundred persons of all ranks, and
including some of various religious bodies, were present, <a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>in testimony of
one who has earned in no common degree, the esteem of his fellow
citizens.&nbsp; We may refer to this tea party as an admirable
example of the mode in which occasions of public interest may be
made the means of stimulating social sympathies, and of promoting
that harmony between the wealthy and the poor, which in England
has been so long and so unhappily interrupted.&nbsp; We may refer
also to the review of the history of Prince&rsquo;s Street
chapel, and of the church and congregation assembling there,
which was read by Mr. Alexander, as a narrative not only full of
interest to all who desire the advancement of religion, but full
of instruction to all who question the power of the voluntary
principle.&nbsp; Here we have an account of a chapel raised, of a
church formed, of a congregation collected to the number of 1000
persons, of missions planted in two neighbouring hamlets, of a
large Sunday school established, and of the active and efficient
maintenance of all these during thirty years, by a comparatively
poor body of persons, at an expense altogether of upwards of
twenty-two thousand pounds.&nbsp; Such a result is no mean proof
of the efficacy of willinghood, when called into exercise by the
ministry of a faithful and zealous pastor, and exerted by an
affectionate and devoted people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history which our esteemed minister read at the meeting,
and which is now printed from his manuscript, it is hoped will be
an interesting and useful document, especially to <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>his own
church and congregation, because it will call to their
remembrance &ldquo;all the way which the Lord their God hath led
them&rdquo; these thirty years; and, as a few additional copies
will be published for the use of the public, it may serve to show
to persons in general, the principles and working of a
congregational church, during a long and varied period of its
existence.</p>
<p>Some beautiful verses composed for the occasion, are inserted
at the conclusion of the history.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">JOHN VENNING,<br />
Chairman of the Meeting.</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>THIRTY
YEARS&rsquo; HISTORY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thirty</span> years are an important
period in the history of an individual, and even in the history
of the world; and during the last thirty years, many events have
occurred, especially in this country, by which society has been
materially and extensively affected.&nbsp; Civil and religious
liberty has been advanced; parliamentary representation has been
reformed; Test and Corporation Acts have been repealed;
Catholics, and Protestants of all denominations, have been
rendered equally eligible for civil offices, and for senatorial
seats; slavery, throughout the British Colonies, has been
abolished; commerce has been brought into fellowship with
freedom; the power of steam has increased the facilities of
manufacturing and of travelling a thousand fold; and various
institutions, for benevolent and religious purposes, have been
established in our <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>land.&nbsp; But, during these thirty years, while these
remarkable changes and improvements have been taking place, a
whole generation of human beings, not less in number than eight
hundred millions, have finished their earthly course, and have
passed into eternity!</p>
<p>During that important period, it has been my privilege to
reside in this city, and to exercise my ministry among you the
members of my church and congregation; and the close of such a
period, affords a suitable opportunity for presenting you with a
brief history of the erection of our place of worship, of the
formation and advancement of the church, and of other
circumstances, connected with our spiritual and ecclesiastical
affairs.</p>
<p>Early in the year 1817, while I was pursuing my studies
preparatory to the christian ministry, in the college at Hoxton,
now removed to Highbury, I received an invitation to visit
Norwich, and to preach, for a few Sabbaths, in the
Tabernacle.&nbsp; This invitation, being sanctioned and urged
upon me by the Committee of the Institution, I accepted for a
period of three weeks, and I left London, by the Day Coach, on
the morning of Good Friday, April 4th, 1817.&nbsp; It <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was a cold and
comfortless journey; the North-east wind blew bitterly; a
passenger on the coach filled me with anxiety and alarm by his
account of the state of things in the Tabernacle; and a few miles
before we reached the city, we were informed that, just as the
Packet was starting to Yarmouth that morning, the boiler had
burst, and eleven of the passengers had been frightfully mangled
and destroyed.&nbsp; On arriving at the city, I went, as I had
been directed, to the Tabernacle house, where Mr. Phillips, the
aged minister, resided, and where I expected to lodge.&nbsp; The
good old man and all his household had gone to bed; and when,
after loud and long knocking at the door, I awoke him from sleep,
and told him my name and my object in coming, he replied,
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know you, Sir,&rdquo; and instantly
shut down the window.&nbsp; This reception, or rather rejection,
though afterwards in some measure explained and apologized for,
was sufficiently discouraging; but as it was impossible to return
to London that night, I determined to sleep at the Inn, and to
wait for the disclosures of the morrow.&nbsp; I was then
introduced to a few of the people, who received me kindly.&nbsp;
The good old minister, too, interested <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and amused me by his lively and
picturesque descriptions of his ministerial life; and I began to
think that perhaps I might remain till the three weeks had
expired.&nbsp; On the first Sunday evening, I preached a sermon
in reference to the Steam Packet catastrophe, which had happened
on the Friday.&nbsp; The text was Matthew xxiv, 44:
&ldquo;Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye
think not, the Son of man cometh.&rdquo;&nbsp; The place was
crowded.&nbsp; The Lord himself stood by me and strengthened
me.&nbsp; The congregation listened with impressive silence and
attention.&nbsp; Many minds seemed to be deeply affected; and I
left the pulpit that night, thanking God, and taking
courage.&nbsp; On the two following Sabbaths, the congregations
were equally large; and when they were over, I returned to
London, partly to pursue my studies, and partly to prepare an
oration on the subject of Ancient Heathenism, which I had been
appointed to deliver at the anniversary of the college; but,
before I left, I promised to return, and to preach during the
whole of the Midsummer vacation.</p>
<p>My labours at the Tabernacle were resumed on Sunday, July
6th.&nbsp; During this visit, the congregations were very
encouraging; and the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>people were so earnest in requesting
me not to return to London at the end of the six weeks&rsquo;
vacation, that, after consulting with my tutors, I agreed to
remain till the legal opinion was given, which would determine
whether the pulpit and the place of worship were under the
control of the church, or of the Trustees.&nbsp; That opinion did
not arrive till the fourteenth of December.&nbsp; It was the
sabbath day.&nbsp; On going to the Tabernacle, I was informed
that the decision was in favour of the Trustees; and as I had
been invited, not by them, but by the church and congregation, I
had therefore no legal right to continue to occupy the
pulpit.&nbsp; I had prepared two sermons for the day.&nbsp; The
text in the morning was, 2 Corinthians iii, 18: &ldquo;We all,
with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the close of the service,
I informed the congregation of the legal decision which had been
given by the Barrister to whom the question had been referred,
and I gave notice that my last sermon in the Tabernacle would be
preached in the evening.&nbsp; A very large congregation
assembled, and much excitement <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and perplexity prevailed.&nbsp; My
text was, Psalm xxx, 5: &ldquo;Weeping may endure for a night,
but joy cometh in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; That text, it was
often said afterwards, built the new chapel.&nbsp; The people
felt as if the language was prophetic; and amidst their night of
weeping, they began to look forward to the morning joy.&nbsp; My
own mind was, however, rather relieved by a decision which seemed
to open the way for my retirement from Norwich.&nbsp; I had
received the most affectionate kindness from the people; they
were evidently exceedingly desirous to secure me as their
minister; and they were willing to make any sacrifices to induce
my continuance.&nbsp; But the prospect of having to build a
chapel; to re-organize the church; to instruct and train up the
people in congregational principles; to originate Sunday Schools,
and other institutions; to control and calm the feelings which
had been excited by the collision with the Trustees of the
Tabernacle; and other circumstances, led me to shrink from an
undertaking for which I felt I was incapable, owing to my youth
and inexperience.&nbsp; The invitation to become their minister,
which was given me, and which was signed by four hundred persons,
was <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>therefore declined on the second of January, 1818; and I
took my place in the coach, to return to London, on my way to
Kidderminster, where I had been requested to supply.&nbsp; But on
the day of my departure, a deputation from the people waited on
me, and pressed upon me the invitation with such affectionate
earnestness, and with such assurances respecting the building of
a new chapel, that I felt the appeal to be irresistible, and I
promised to lay the whole matter before my tutors and friends,
and to make it the subject of serious and prayerful
re-consideration.&nbsp; The result was, a determination to
return; and I did return to preach my first sermon in the
Lancasterian School, on the twenty-fifth of January, 1818.&nbsp;
The text was, &ldquo;O Lord, I beseech thee send now
prosperity&rdquo;&mdash;a prayer which, from that time to the
present, the God of mercy has abundantly answered.&nbsp; In that
school room we worshipped twice on the Sunday, and in the French
church on the week evenings, for nearly two years.&nbsp; The
congregations on the sabbath, and especially in the evening, were
as large as the place could contain; many &ldquo;times of
refreshing&rdquo; were granted to us from the presence of the
Lord; and we often said, &ldquo;This <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>is none other than the house of God,
and the gate of heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were now anxiously occupied in seeking for a suitable piece
of ground on which to build our chapel; and after long delay, and
many difficulties, the present site was purchased, and I laid the
foundation stone, on the 16th of March, 1819.&nbsp; An address
was delivered on the occasion, which was afterwards published;
and the following inscription was engraved on a brass plate,
which was laid on the top of the stone, in the centre of which
were deposited several specimens of current coin: &ldquo;This
plate was deposited the sixteenth day of March, one thousand
eight hundred and nineteen, and in the fifty-ninth year of the
reign of George the Third, in the foundation stone of a
Protestant Dissenting Chapel, erected on a piece of freehold
ground, in the City of Norwich, and in the parishes of St.
Michael at Plea and St. Peter Hungate, by the congregation
attending the ministry of the Rev. John Alexander.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The building was completed in about eight months; and the time
drew near for us to enter it.&nbsp; The last sabbath which we
spent in the Lancasterian school room, was on November <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the 28th,
1819.&nbsp; The last text, was the prayer which Moses addressed
to God, in Exodus xxxiii, 15: &ldquo;If thy presence go not with
us carry us not up hence.&rdquo;&nbsp; During our meetings there,
we had enjoyed many tokens of the divine presence; the cloud of
his glory had blessed and sanctified the place; and the preacher
and the people unitedly felt, that it would be better to remain
in that humble dwelling, God being with us, than to enter our new
and beautiful chapel, unaccompanied with his presence.&nbsp; On
the Wednesday following, December 1st, 1819, the chapel was
opened for divine worship.&nbsp; The sermon in the morning was
preached by Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool, and many of us remember
how our hearts glowed with holy delight when he read his text,
Exodus, xx, 24: &ldquo;In all places where I record my name, I
will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
leaving the School Room, we offered up the prayer, &ldquo;If thy
presence go not with us, carry us not up hence;&rdquo; on
entering the chapel we received the gracious answer, &ldquo;I
will come unto thee, and I will bless thee;&rdquo; an answer
which has been verified from that day to the present.&nbsp; In
the evening Dr. <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Leifchild preached a most impressive sermon from
Hebrews, xii, 25: &ldquo;See that ye refuse not him that
speaketh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus entered the chapel, our attention was soon
directed to the desirableness of forming a church.&nbsp; After
much deliberation and prayer on the subject, thirteen persons of
good report among us, agreed to unite together in christian
fellowship, believing each other to be the disciples of Christ,
and having the sanction of the minister, and of various christian
brethren.&nbsp; On the 8th of March, 1820, they held their first
ecclesiastical meeting in the vestry of the chapel.&nbsp; The
Rev. William Hull, of the Old Meeting, Norwich, and the Rev.
Alexander Creak, of Yarmouth, presided.&nbsp; After prayer and
the reading of the scriptures, Mr. Creak described the nature and
duties of a christian church; after which Mr. William Parkinson,
one of the members, read the following declaration.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having invited your presence, as ministers
of Jesus Christ, to recognize and acknowledge our formation into
a christian church, we deem it proper to give you a brief account
of those doctrines of religion which we profess to believe and to
experience.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;While we disclaim all regard to doctrines derived
merely from the word of man, we find that the religious
sentiments we profess, and which we receive as the word of God,
correspond with the doctrines commonly called Calvinistic, and
that our sentiments respecting church discipline correspond with
those which are maintained by the body of Protestant Dissenters
commonly called Independents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctrines contained in our religious creed, and
which we firmly believe to be recorded in the scriptures of
truth, comprise the being, perfections, and unity of God; the
union of the divine and human natures in the person of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ; the personality, deity, and influences
of the Holy Spirit; the fall of man, and its awful consequences
in the universal depravity of human nature; the atonement made
for sinners by the obedience and death of Jesus Christ; the
sovereign and gracious election of the people of God to faith,
and holiness, and eternal life; their justification by faith in
&lsquo;the Lord our righteousness;&rsquo; their regeneration and
sanctification by the Holy Spirit; their adoption into the family
of heaven; their certain perseverance in grace, and final <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>acceptance
with God; the resurrection of the body at the last day; and the
final judgment of all mankind at the bar of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We consider a christian church to be a congregation of
believers, voluntarily assembling together, and submitting, in
all things, to Jesus Christ, their only Lord and Master.&nbsp;
Such a church we desire to become; recognizing a pastor and
deacons as our only officers, and asserting our exclusive right
to make our own independent choice of a minister, to watch over
us in the Lord, and of deacons, to attend to our temporal
concerns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ordinances of the church we consider to be Baptism
and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; The former to be administered
to unbaptized and believing adults, and also to their infant
offspring; and the latter to be administered to those only who
profess their faith in Jesus Christ, and are joined in fellowship
with his people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having made this declaration of our faith and practice,
in which we all most cordially unite, we confess that, as guilty
sinners, our only hope is in the righteousness of Jesus Christ;
and having, we trust, first given ourselves to the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Lord, we
desire now in your presence, and in the presence of Almighty God,
to unite together in church fellowship, that we may enjoy the
communion of saints, and walk in the ordinances and commandments
of the Lord blamelessly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This declaration having been read, the ministers present
acknowledged the persons assembled to be a church of Christ, and
gave to them the right hand of fellowship; after which, the
members shook hands with each other.&nbsp; My dismission from the
Independent Church in Liverpool, under the pastoral care of the
Rev. P. S. Charrier, was then read, on which I was received into
membership with the newly-formed church.&nbsp; Of the fourteen
persons who thus composed this infant church, seven are alive and
remain unto this day: six hundred and sixty-eight persons have
since been added to them making the whole number six hundred and
eighty-two; an increase, for which devout gratitude is due to Him
by whose gracious power alone sinners are constrained first to
give themselves to the Lord, and then to his people according to
his will.</p>
<p>But though a church had thus been formed and recognized by the
pastoral representatives <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of other churches, and though I had
become united with it, my membership did not, of course,
constitute me its pastor; but, on receiving an invitation from
the church to sustain that office among them, I at once accepted
it, and it was agreed that my ordination should take place at the
end of May.&nbsp; The independent ministers in the county, and
some of those in the neighbouring counties, were invited to
attend on the occasion, as the representatives of their churches,
in order that their sanction might be given to our proceedings;
and the following extract from the Church Book will shew the
manner in which the service was conducted.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The solemn service of Mr. Alexander&rsquo;s
ordination to the pastoral office over the church assembling for
divine worship in Prince&rsquo;s Street Chapel, Norwich, took
place on Wednesday morning, May 31, 1820, in the following
order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Isaac Sloper, of Beccles, implored the divine
presence and blessing by a suitable prayer, after which he read
the third chapter of the first of Timothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Thomas Craig, of Bocking, delivered the
introductory discourse, which contained <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>a statement
of the reasons of dissent, and of the principles of a christian
church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brief account of the circumstances which led to Mr.
Alexander&rsquo;s residence with the people was then read by Mr.
Gurney, one of the members of the church; after which all the
members testified, by holding up the right hand, that they had
unanimously invited Mr. Alexander to the pastoral office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In reply to questions proposed by Mr. Craig, Mr.
Alexander gave an account of his religious experience, and stated
his motives for entering the christian ministry; his reasons of
dissent from the Established Church; his cordial acceptance of
the call of the church; his determination, by the help of divine
grace, to approve himself as a minister of Christ; and his belief
in the great doctrines of the everlasting gospel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. George Collison, of Hackney, then offered up a
most solemn and impressive ordination prayer, connected with the
imposition of hands; after which each of the ministers present
gave to Mr. Alexander the right hand of fellowship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Peter Samuel Charrier, of Liverpool, Mr.
Alexander&rsquo;s late pastor, addressed to <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>him a very
affectionate and appropriate charge, from Acts xx, 24: &lsquo;So
that I might finish my course with joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Edward Hickman, of Denton, very affectionately
and suitably addressed the church and congregation, from
Philippians i, 27: &lsquo;Only let your conversation be as it
becometh the gospel of Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Richard Fairbrother, of Dereham, read the
hymns selected for the occasion; and the Rev. John Dennant, of
Halesworth, concluded the service with prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The above service was conducted in the presence of a
very numerous and attentive congregation, and evidently in the
enjoyment of His presence, who says to his ministers, &lsquo;Lo!
I am with you always to the end of the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
indeed a time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord; and
never may the minister, and never may the people forget the vows
which they then formed, nor lose the impressions which they then
received.&nbsp; May the union, thus solemnly and publicly
recognised, continue uninterrupted and unbroken till terminated
by the stroke of death; and may the pastor and all the people
hereafter meet and dwell together in that <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>holy and
happy world, where sin, and death, and sorrow, shall be known no
more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A church needs however not only a Pastor, as its Bishop, who
is to &ldquo;give himself continually to prayer, and to the
ministry of the word,&rdquo; but Deacons also, to superintend its
temporal affairs, and &ldquo;to serve tables.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
church therefore, in the first instance, chose two of its members
to that office; a number which has been increased again and
again, as the necessities of the church required.&nbsp; In
addition to the meetings of the church for devotional purposes,
it has always held a meeting once a month for general business,
and these meetings have been chiefly occupied in the reception of
members.&nbsp; Sometimes, when a member has been going to reside
in some other town, we have had to grant him a letter of
commendation and dismission to the church with which he has
wished to unite, and on which that church has received him.&nbsp;
Sometimes, we have had to discuss questions relative to the best
mode of proceeding in the election of officers, and in the
transaction of other business.&nbsp; And sometimes, we have had
to investigate charges against character, and solemnly to exclude
an unworthy <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>member.&nbsp; And when a church can keep &ldquo;the
spirit of the world&rdquo; from mingling with its proceedings,
its very discussions, as well as its devotions, are highly
beneficial, and contribute to the acquisition of &ldquo;manly
piety,&rdquo; and to the exercise of holy wisdom and of brotherly
love.&nbsp; On such occasions, when every brother is free to
hold, and free to express his own convictions, it is a degree of
liberty which, though liable to abuse, is one of the invaluable
privileges of the church of Christ; and when used in his spirit,
and in accordance with his directions, is one of the sources of
its strength and security.&nbsp; Amidst the great variety of
proceedings in which, as a church, we have had to engage, it has
been our mercy &ldquo;to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people have been &ldquo;kindly
affectioned one towards another, and towards their pastor, in
brotherly love;&rdquo; so that, amidst our many imperfections and
infirmities, God has dealt very graciously with his servants, and
the cloud of his glory has continued to rest over our
assemblies.&nbsp; Our church meetings, from the beginning, have
been seasons of much spiritual enjoyment and edification.&nbsp;
The letters which have been read to us, from such candidates for
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>communion
as have been disposed to write them, and the reports of the faith
and experience of the various candidates, which have been related
to us by the brethren who have visited them, have often filled
our hearts with gladness and our eyes with tears, and have been,
beyond all description, edifying and animating to our
souls.&nbsp; Hundreds of those letters, still in the possession
of the pastor, many of them from the hands of beloved young
persons, and some of them written by hands which have long since
&ldquo;forgot their cunning,&rdquo; are among the richest rewards
of pastoral labour, and the strongest attestations to the power
and excellency of the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>In connection with this abundant degree of peace and
prosperity, our course has however been attended, externally at
least, with difficulty and tribulation, and we have had to build
the walls of our Zion in troublous times.&nbsp; It was no easy
thing for a young and inexperienced minister to have the
formation and guidance of an infant church committed to his care,
and at the same time to have to give attention to reading; to
have to prepare three, and afterwards four sermons every week;
besides visiting the sick; <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>attending a weekly prayer-meeting;
conducting two separate Bible classes, which at one time he had
in charge; preaching occasionally at Thorpe and at Trowse, two
village stations in connection with the chapel; and attending the
committees and public meetings of various religious institutions
in the city and county.&nbsp; In the earlier periods of these
labours, the debt which remained on the chapel began to press
with most burdensome weight; and those who had advanced the
largest sums of money, became more than wishful for
repayment.&nbsp; Once, the income of the minister was taken for
the payment of the interest; but it was immediately returned to
him, doubled in amount, by an affectionate and sympathizing
congregation.&nbsp; One difficulty became, however, the
forerunner and progenitor of another, as is generally the case
when a chapel is burdened with an oppressive debt; and at length
the state of things became so harassing and intolerable,
especially to the pastor&rsquo;s mind, that after many struggles
and much mental suffering, he wrote a letter resigning the
pastoral office, and sent it to the church on February 4th,
1825.&nbsp; That letter, though sent, was never opened; for just
as the church <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>assembled, an arrangement was completed by which the
burden of debt was diminished, and by which some persons, whose
pecuniary claims had been urgently pressed, were satisfied.&nbsp;
Thus our extremity became God&rsquo;s opportunity; and the
minister and the people, instead of being separated, became,
through mutual suffering, still more closely and affectionately
united.</p>
<p>As the congregation had become pledged to raise between eight
and nine hundred pounds in five years, to effect the proposed
liquidation of the debt, every hand became engaged in the work,
and great labour and liberality were manifested.&nbsp; But our
troubles were not yet terminated.&nbsp; At the end of two years,
out of the five, it was discovered that the roof of the chapel,
which had been constructed on a false principle, was giving way,
and that it, together with the upper part of the walls, must be
taken down.&nbsp; The expence of doing this would be full three
hundred pounds; we had yet to raise more than that sum towards
the debt; how was it possible to do both? especially as the
congregation must, for some time at least, leave the chapel, and
perhaps be irrecoverably dispersed; for it was now the beginning
of winter, and four or five <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>months must elapse, before the place
could be repaired, and rendered fit for our return.&nbsp; We were
perplexed, and almost in despair.&nbsp; But again, by God&rsquo;s
great mercy, our light rose in obscurity, and the night of
weeping was followed by the morning joy.&nbsp; The Lancasterian
School, the Old Meeting House, and the French Church, were kindly
granted to us, for our Sunday and our week-day worship; the
congregation, instead of sinking into despondency, was roused to
exertions the most zealous and liberal; our Christian friends in
the Old Meeting, and in St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel&mdash;Baptists as
well as Independents, affectionately sympathised with our
circumstances; and in the course of a few days presented to us
the noble sum of upwards of a hundred guineas; the walls were
re-built; a new and substantial roof was raised; and we returned
to the place on the 16th of March, 1828, with as large a
congregation as we had when we left it, and which from that time
continued to increase till every seat was occupied!&nbsp; Then
too, the God of all grace began to enrich us with a greater
increase of spiritual prosperity.&nbsp; Many sinners were
converted; the church was enlarged, and confirmed, and edified;
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>our Sunday
Schools were invigorated; our interest in the place, and in each
other, was strengthened; and God himself seemed again to repeat
his gracious promise, &ldquo;I will come unto thee, and I will
bless thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since that period we have made several alterations and
improvements in our place of worship; and on one of these
occasions, in 1842, we worshipped in the Dutch Church for the
space of two months.&nbsp; Our own service was in the morning and
evening; and the service of the Church of England, conducted by
the clergyman of the place, was in the afternoon.&nbsp; On one of
the afternoons, the service was conducted by the venerable and
excellent Bishop of the Diocese, who preached from the same
pulpit that had been occupied in the morning by the Dissenting
minister; and during our stay there, we had sermons from
ministers belonging to almost every evangelical denomination of
the Christian church.&nbsp; In our own place of worship too, it
has often been our privilege to contribute, in some degree, to
the general communion of saints; especially at the Lord&rsquo;s
table, the first place at which Christians should meet, and the
last at which they should separate.&nbsp; There we <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>have been
joined by Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists,
who have eaten with us of the same bread, and who have drank of
the same cup, in devout remembrance of Him, who purchased the
church with his precious blood.</p>
<p>One of the objects to which we directed our attention, soon
after the opening of the chapel, was the formation of a <i>Sunday
School</i>.&nbsp; Several young persons, of piety and zeal,
offered themselves as teachers, some of whom continue to the
present day, honourably and usefully employed in the beneficial
work.&nbsp; We began in July 1820, with eighty-one
scholars.&nbsp; The pastor advised the teachers to form the
committee out of their own body; to have no more rules for the
regulation of the school than circumstances rendered necessary;
to conduct all their affairs religiously; and to apply to their
minister, whenever they needed help or encouragement.&nbsp; This
undertaking, which has been pursued with unabating ardour and
vigour to the present day, has been abundantly prospered by the
divine blessing.&nbsp; Not less than three thousand children
have, from time to time, received from it some degree or other of
religious instruction.&nbsp; Many of these <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>children have
become teachers; some of them have died in the Lord; and at our
Sunday School anniversaries, we have listened to many affecting
and spirit-stirring details of the resignation and the joyful
hope, which they have expressed in the prospect of death and
heaven.&nbsp; The school too, has been a fruitful nursery for the
church.&nbsp; For many years past, we have seldom had a church
meeting without receiving some one as a member, whose religious
impressions were either derived or deepened from his education,
or from his employment, in the school.&nbsp; At this time, in
addition to twenty-three youths in the monitorial class,
preparing to become teachers, there are no less than a hundred
and twenty, chiefly young persons, belonging to the church and
congregation, who are actually engaged as Sunday School Teachers
in Prince&rsquo;s Street, and in our other schools; and though,
during nearly the last thirty years, they and their predecessors
have conducted the general business of the schools entirely by
themselves, yet they have co-operated steadily and cordially; no
root of bitterness has sprung up to trouble them; and, by the
grace of God, they still continue to feel and to manifest
&ldquo;how good and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>together in
unity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such an institution, it will easily be
perceived, must have afforded great help to the interests of
religion in the congregation, and great encouragement to the
pastor.&nbsp; It has indeed often been his solace in adversity,
and one of his chief joys in prosperity; and his heart is glad of
the opportunity, which this festival affords, to acknowledge the
large circle of Sunday School Teachers, by whom he is surrounded,
as his fellow labourers in Christ, and as the joy and crown of
his ministry.</p>
<p>Our Sunday School operations however, have not been confined
to the chapel in Prince&rsquo;s street.&nbsp; We have supplied
Teachers to the school in <i>Pockthorpe</i>, two of whom were
mainly instrumental in raising money for the erection of the
present spacious building, which is used for an Infant School
during the week, as well as for a Sunday School; and we have also
supplied Teachers to the school in <i>Stepping Lane</i>, and to
some others, while we have entirely supported the schools and the
chapels in the villages of Thorpe and Trowse.&nbsp; Mr. Alexander
began to preach in a Room at <i>Thorpe</i> in the year 1819,
which, several years afterwards, began to be supplied by some of
the members of his church.&nbsp; <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>The attendance there became at length
so numerous and encouraging, that it was determined to build a
chapel; and after encountering many discouraging difficulties, a
suitable piece of ground was obtained; and the present building
was erected, at a cost, including the ground of &pound;450,
towards which one liberal friend contributed &pound;100.&nbsp;
The chapel was opened for divine worship in 1839, and the Sunday
School was formed in the same year.&nbsp; Four religious services
are conducted in the chapel weekly, by members of our church;
about eighty children are instructed in the Sunday School; and
there is a Vestry Library for the use of the congregation.&nbsp;
The Sunday School at <i>Trowse</i> was established as early as
1821, and about seven years afterwards, we began to preach the
gospel there; but we did not occupy the present chapel till
1830.&nbsp; There is religious service in it four times every
week; a Sunday School containing a hundred and fifty children;
and a circulating Library for the use of the village.&nbsp; We
hope soon to be enabled to erect another chapel there in a better
situation, which may also be used for both Day and Sunday
Schools.&nbsp; During the last eight years, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Mr.
Barnsdale, who from the beginning has devotedly laboured for the
welfare of Trowse, has been employed by us as a Missionary in the
two villages of Trowse and Thorpe, on the plan of the City
Mission; and the Reports which he has read at our quarterly
meetings, have made us acquainted, not only with the peculiar
difficulties which the gospel has to contend with in villages
situated near a large city, but also with many blessed triumphs
which that gospel has gained over human depravity, in the
regeneration and salvation of the souls of men.</p>
<p>Our thirty years have therefore been spent, not only in
overcoming our own difficulties, and in establishing and
increasing ourselves, but also in endeavouring to extend the
knowledge and influence of the gospel in the regions
beyond.&nbsp; This indeed is the combined duty of every religious
society.&nbsp; The church was instituted by its divine Lord, not
only for preserving and professing the truths of the gospel, but
also for propagating them.&nbsp; This, you know, has always been
urged upon you from the pulpit as a solemn duty, and though you
have perhaps sometimes felt as if you had been urged too much;
and though your pastor has sometimes <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>been kindly warned that his own
resources would be diminished, if he so earnestly pleaded for
foreign objects; yet, I trust, many of you have found that the
money you have given, and especially the personal efforts you
have put forth, for the spread of the gospel, have not been in
vain in the Lord, but have been spiritually advantageous to
yourselves, as well as to others.&nbsp; As one consequence of
these appeals and urgings, your pastor has always been associated
with many fellow-labourers in the work of the Lord, who have been
distributors of tracts, collectors for public Institutions,
christian Instruction Agents, Sunday School Teachers, conductors
of prayer meetings, and preachers of the gospel in the
neighbouring villages.&nbsp; And by so doing, you have been the
means of converting sinners from the error of their way, and of
saving their souls from death; your personal piety and the
prosperity of the church has been advanced; your pastor&rsquo;s
heart has been strengthened and comforted; and the name of Christ
has been glorified.&nbsp; May the Lord of the harvest never fail
to supply us with such labourers, and may all succeeding pastors
and members of the church, be constrained, by the love of Christ,
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>&ldquo;to
live not to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several other Institutions, which it is needful or desirable
should be formed in connection with a church of Christ, exist
among us; some of which are more particularly for the use of our
own congregation, and others for the general interests of
humanity and religion.&nbsp; The Society for the relief of our
<i>sick and aged poor</i>, was instituted in 1821, and has all
along been most economically and efficiently conducted by a
committee of ladies, who meet for business once a month, and who
visit and relieve the needy and afflicted objects.&nbsp; They
have thus distributed full &pound;330.&nbsp; The <i>Provident
Society</i> was instituted in 1835, and affords an opportunity
for any person in the congregation, or for any child in the
Sunday School, to secure a sum of money weekly during sickness,
and a pension for old age, by paying a proportionate monthly
subscription during health.&nbsp; It has received from these
payments about &pound;200.&nbsp; The <i>Vestry Libraries</i>,
connected with the chapel in Prince&rsquo;s Street, contain
nearly a thousand well-selected volumes on various subjects, but
especially on religious subjects; to which any persons in the <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>congregation
have access, on subscribing a shilling a quarter, and to which
the Sunday School Teachers and children have access
gratuitously.&nbsp; Our <i>Christian Instruction Society</i>, was
formed for the purpose of paying religious visits, and for
distributing tracts, in several districts, chiefly in the
neighbourhood of the chapel; and though the subsequent
institution of the City Mission has, in some measure, superseded
its labours, there are now about fifteen agents connected with
it, and it occupies a room in King-street for religious worship
on the Sabbath.&nbsp; We have also auxiliaries and associations
formed among us on behalf of the <i>London Missionary
Society</i>, for sending the gospel to the heathen; on behalf of
<i>British Missions</i>, embracing the Home Missionary Society,
the Irish Evangelical Society, and the Colonial Missionary
Society; on behalf of the <i>County Association</i> for the
spread of the gospel in Norfolk; and on behalf of the <i>Norwich
City Mission</i>; besides granting collections and subscriptions
to various other religious institutions, formed for promoting the
spiritual welfare of our fellow countrymen, and of mankind at
large.</p>
<p>The amount of money required for these <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>various
purposes and for the support of the ministry, has of course not
been small.&nbsp; A careful effort has been made, to obtain a
full and correct account; but it has been found impossible to
ascertain all the items.&nbsp; Since the chapel was opened, many
public collections have been made, of which there is no record,
and which are now entirely forgotten.&nbsp; The following account
may be considered correct as far as it goes, and at the end of it
something may be added for omissions.</p>

<p>The total amount of all these sums is &pound;22,200 18s. 4d.;
and we may safely add at least &pound;300 for subscriptions and
collections which cannot be remembered; so that, in about
twenty-nine years, there has been collected, for various
purposes, the large sum of &pound;22,500.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>All
this money, it must be remembered, has come from a congregation,
which though numerous, has not been rich; and it has been
contributed by them, not as a compulsory tax, but in addition to
the compulsory taxes which they have been compelled to pay
towards the Church Establishment from which they have
conscientiously dissented.&nbsp; We have, therefore, &ldquo;not
robbed other churches&rdquo; for the support of our own; but all
our contributions have been given on the voluntary principle, and
as a freewill offering, which in many cases have, no doubt, been
given as unto the Lord, and not unto men.&nbsp; It has indeed
been contributed by a people who have often been taught the duty
and importance of giving both money and personal efforts to the
cause of Christ, as a testimony of allegiance to their Lord and
Master, and as a means of personal prosperity and
usefulness.&nbsp; And let any people, under the influence of
religion, which is the true voluntary principle, be suitably
appealed to by their minister for pecuniary help, on behalf of
institutions for the spread of the gospel, and he will be far
from injuring either them or himself.&nbsp; They will become
better and happier by helping others, and he and his family <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>will be the
better and the happier too&mdash;at least such is the testimony
which the pastor of Prince&rsquo;s Street can bear, relative to
himself, and to his liberal congregation.</p>
<p>Such, brethren, is our eventful and varied history, as a
church and congregation, during the last thirty years&mdash;a
history which, on the review, most impressively reminds your
pastor of many imperfections and infirmities, which have been
connected with him as a man, a christian, and a minister; and on
account of which he finds it needful every day to humble himself
before God, and to say, &ldquo;Enter not into judgment with thy
servant, O Lord;&rdquo; and yet a history which, even so far as
he is concerned, has afforded many remarkable manifestations of
divine love and mercy.&nbsp; He had, for many years, an abundant
degree of bodily health, which enabled him to do the work of the
Lord laboriously and happily; he has had a large share of
domestic comfort and privilege, and now is surrounded by a
beloved family, most of whom are his spiritual as well as his
natural relatives, and some of whom are gone to be for ever with
the Lord; he has been privileged with a large degree of public
friendship and approbation, and <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>has many beloved and esteemed friends
in surrounding churches, some of whom are of other denominations,
and some of whom are the fruits of his ministry; he has, above
all these things, been abundantly honoured and blessed by the
Great Head of the church, in promoting the conversion of sinners,
and the peace and union of the church, in whose affectionate
confidence it has been his privilege to live; and though latterly
health has occasionally failed, and now and then he has been
admonished that his master will soon require his services in
another world, yet, thanks be to God, for that degree of vigour
and buoyancy which yet remains, and which he is more desirous
than ever should be consecrated to your spiritual welfare; and,
thanks be to God, for that good and joyful hope which he
cherishes, that when his earthly labours are concluded, he shall
be gathered to the fellowship of the redeemed and the Redeemer,
in the many mansions of his Father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>But, beloved brethren, the history of the last thirty years
affords many subjects for grateful and humbling review to
yourselves, as well as to your pastor.&nbsp; You have erected a
noble chapel, which will be, I trust, during future years, as it
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>has been
during the past, the spiritual birthplace of immortal souls; you
have had a Christian church formed among you, in which &ldquo;one
is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren,&rdquo; and
which, through the power and grace of the Holy Spirit, has
increased, from fourteen, to nearly seven hundred members; you
have enjoyed, amidst the services of the sanctuary, many a time
of sweet and heavenly refreshing; you have, in connection with
your own place of worship, many valuable institutions, conducted
by zealous and laborious individuals, and which are the salt and
savour of the church; you have two very important and interesting
village stations under your care, in one of which you have built
a chapel, and in both of which you support a worthy missionary,
preach the gospel, and teach Sunday Schools; you have cheerfully
and sufficiently supported your own minister; you have paid your
own congregational expences; and you have contributed to various
religious objects and institutions the noble sum of twenty-two
thousand five hundred pounds; and now, at the close of the first
thirty years of your ecclesiastical history, you have assembled
together, to review the past with <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>humble gratitude to God; to testify
your unabated attachment to the pastor of your voluntary choice;
and to enter upon another thirty years, which, as they roll
along, will bear away many of you, and me also, into the eternal
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Let thy work</span>,
<span class="smcap">O Lord</span>, <span class="smcap">appear
unto thy servants</span>, <span class="smcap">and thy glory unto
their children</span>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">And let the

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
